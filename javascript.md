Javascript: JavaScript is a popular web scripting language and is used for client-side and server-side development. It doesn't need compilation before running the application. Javascript application are meant to run inside the browser.

variable name cannot start with numeric value.

callback function?

Cookies - Cookies are small pieces of data that are stored on a user's device when they visit a website. They are used to remember various types of information, such as user preferences, login sessions, and tracking data.

let - block scope, var - function scope, const - constant throught the javascript program.

closures in javascript.

What are Imports and Exports in JavaScript?
Imports and exports help in writing modular code for our JavaScript applications. With the help of imports and exports, we can split a JavaScript code into multiple files in a project. This greatly simplifies the application source code and encourages code readability.

document and window?

localStorage:
Data stored in localStorage persists even after the browser is closed and is available for future sessions.
Data stored in localStorage has no expiration time and remains stored until explicitly removed by the user or the application.
Data stored in localStorage is shared among all tabs and windows from the same origin (domain).

sessionStorage:
Data stored in sessionStorage is available only within the same session. A session is defined as the duration of the tab or window being open.
Data stored in sessionStorage is not shared between different tabs or windows, even if they are from the same origin.
Data stored in sessionStorage is automatically cleared when the tab or window is closed or when the user navigates away from the page.

this keyword in javascript?

Arrow functions are used to write functions with a short and concise syntax.  Also, it does not require a function keyword for declaration. An arrow function can be omitted with curly braces { } when we have one line of code.

> Hoisting in javascript is the default process behavior of moving declaration of all the variables and functions on top of the scope where scope can be either local or global.

== operator is a comparison operator that used to compare the values
=== operator is also a comparison operator that is used to compare the values as well as types.

Implicit Type Coercion:
When the value of one data type is automatically converted into another data type, it is called Implicit type coercion in javascript. e.g- 4 + "12" = "412"

Statically Typed Language:
In a statically typed language, the data type of a variable is determined at compile-time, and once a variable is declared with a certain type, it cannot be changed. The compiler performs type checking to catch type-related errors before the code is executed.
Examples of statically typed languages include Java, C++, and Swift.
Advantages:
Early detection of type-related errors at compile-time.
Improved code quality and reliability.
Better performance due to compile-time optimizations.
Disadvantages:
Can be more verbose due to explicit type declarations.
May require more effort when dealing with generic or polymorphic code.

Dynamically Typed Language:
In a dynamically typed language, the data type of a variable is determined at runtime when the code is executed. Variables can change their type during their lifetime, and type-related errors are often detected during runtime.
Examples of dynamically typed languages include JavaScript, Python, and Ruby.
Advantages:
More flexibility and less verbose code due to no need for explicit type declarations.
Easier to work with when dealing with dynamic data or rapid prototyping.
Disadvantages:
Type-related errors may only be discovered during runtime, leading to potential runtime failures.
Can be less efficient due to runtime type checking and conversions.
