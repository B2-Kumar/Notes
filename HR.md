Introduce Yourself.
I am Bittu Kumar, a final year B.Tech student pursuing Computer Science and Engineering at NIT Patna. My passion for technology and learning has been a driving force throughout my academic journey. Being a quick learner, I always seek opportunities to learn and explore new technologies.

Data structures and algorithms are my strong suits, and I possess proficient development skills. My love for problem-solving has led me to devote substantial time to upskilling and honing my abilities in this domain.I am proud to have qualified for ICPC regionals this year, achieved expert status on Codeforces, earned a 5-star rating on CodeChef, and reached the rank of Guardian on LeetCode, placing me among the top 2 percent of users.

Apart from academics, I have a few hobbies as well. I enjoy competitive programming as it challenges my problem-solving skills. In my free time, i enjoy playing cricket and love listening to music to relax and unwind.

I embrace each day as an opportunity for self improvement and strive to evolve into the best version of myself both personally ans professionally.
