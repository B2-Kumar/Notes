Introduce Yourself.

Good Morning sir,
My name is Bittu Kumar. I am a final year B.Tech student pursuing Computer Science and Engineering at NIT Patna. My passion for technology and learning has been a driving force throughout my academic journey. Being a quick learner, I always seek opportunities to learn and explore new technologies.

One of my main interests lies in competitive programming and problem solving. Some of my achievements are - I have qualified for the ICPC regionals this year and achieved an All India rank of 43. I am expert on codeforces, 5 star on codechef and among top 1 percent coder on leetcode with current ratings more than 2100.

Beyond coding challenges, I've also explored web development. I'm familiar with technologies like ReactJS, Node.js, and MongoDB. I've put these skills to use by creating projects like a food delivery app, portfolio website and a few more. 

I've also done some freelancing work as a problem setter at imocha, where I designed and tested problems related to data structures and algorithms.

Talking about my hobbies, I enjoy participating in contest as it enhances my problem-solving skills. In my free time, i enjoy playing cricket and love listening to music to relax and unwind.

I embrace each day as an opportunity for self improvement and strive to evolve into the best version of myself both personally ans professionally.
