Introduce Yourself.

Good Morning sir,
My name is Bittu Kumar. I am a final year B.Tech student pursuing Computer Science and Engineering at NIT Patna. My passion for technology and learning has been a driving force throughout my academic career. Being a quick learner, I always seek opportunities to learn and explore new technologies.

One of my main interests lies in competitive programming and Data Structure and Algorithms. Some of my achievements are - I have qualified for the ICPC regionals this year and achieved All India rank of 43. I am expert on codeforces, 5 star on codechef. I am also Guardian on Leetcode and among top 1% in contest ratings.

Beyond coding challenges, I've also explored web development. I'm familiar with technologies like React, Node, Express and MongoDB. I've put these skills to use by creating projects like a food delivery app, portfolio website and a few more. 

I've also done some freelancing work as a problem setter at imocha, where I created and tested problems related to data structures and algorithms.

Talking about my hobbies, I enjoy participating in contest as it enhances my problem-solving skills. In my free time, i enjoy playing cricket.

I embrace each day as an opportunity for self improvement and strive to evolve into the best version of myself both personally ans professionally.
