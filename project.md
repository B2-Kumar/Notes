Control Flow of Project : 
I have created a resposive and food delivery app where i have used react for the frontend development , node and express for the backend development and mongoDB as a database. I have used react in the frontend as it is a single page application, declarative and uses virtual dom for rendering and updating the page thus making the appliction faster. I have used node js in the backend as it uses javascript which is same as used by react in the frontend. It can also handle asynchronous function efficiently with the help of event loop. Along with node i have used express as a framework as it simplifies the process of building apis and implementing middleware funtions. I have used mongoDB as a database because it is open source, No-Sql and stores data in JSON format.
