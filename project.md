Introduce Your Project :

I have created a resposive and food delivery app where i have used react for the frontend development , node and express for the backend development and mongoDB as a database. I have used react in the frontend as it is a single page application, declarative and uses virtual dom for rendering and updating the page thus making the appliction faster. I have used node js in the backend as it uses javascript which is same as used by react in the frontend. It can also handle asynchronous function efficiently with the help of event loop. Along with node i have used express as a framework as it simplifies the process of building apis and implementing middleware funtions. I have used mongoDB as a database because it is open source, No-Sql and stores data in JSON format.

Basic structure and workflow of the project:

- User Registration:
User enters registration details (name, email, password, address) and submits the form in the frontend.
Data is sent to the backend via APIs.
Backend validates the data (e.g., checks for valid email format).
Backend checks if the user already exists in the database using the provided email.
If the user doesn't exist, the password is hashed and stored securely in the database.
If the user already exists, an error message is sent back to the frontend.
- User Login:
User enters login credentials (email, password) and submits the form in the frontend.
Data is sent to the backend via APIs.
Backend validates the data (e.g., checks for valid email format).
Backend finds the user in the database based on the provided email.
Backend uses bcrypt to compare the hashed password in the database with the provided password.
If the password matches, the user is logged in; otherwise, an error message is sent to the frontend.
- Food Ordering:
Authenticated user searches for food items and adds them to the cart.
User completes payment using credit/debit card.
payment is done with the help of stripe payment gateway.
Upon successful payment, a notification indicates the order was successful.
Order data is sent to the backend via APIs.
Backend checks if the user's email already exists in the orders database.
If the email doesn't exist, a new order is created.
If the email exists, the order data is added to the user's existing orders.
- Viewing Order History:
Authenticated user clicks on "My Orders" to view their order history.
Backend searches for the user's email in the orders database.
If the email is found, the user's order history is retrieved and sent to the frontend for display.

what is biggest challenge that you have faced while making this project?

Challenge 1: Complexity and Over-Usage:
Issue: Overusing the Context API can lead to unnecessary complexity in the component tree.
Solution: Carefully assess which parts of the app truly need global state. Avoid putting too much state in context. Use component state or other state management for local state.
Challenge 2: Performance Considerations:
Issue: Context updates can trigger re-renders in all consumers, impacting performance.
Solution: Optimize performance by using memoization techniques (e.g., React.memo, useMemo) to prevent unnecessary re-renders. Consider using libraries for fine-grained control over context updates.
Challenge 3: Limited Scoping:
Issue: Multiple instances of the same context provider can lead to unexpected behavior.
Solution: Plan context provider hierarchy carefully. Use higher-order components to ensure proper context scoping and prevent conflicts.
Challenge 4: Testing Complex Consumers:
Issue: Testing components consuming context can be difficult due to the need to mock context values.
Solution: Utilize testing libraries (e.g., react-testing-library, enzyme) to mock context and provide custom context values for testing different scenarios.
Challenge 5: Debugging and Tracking Data Flow:
Issue: Debugging context-related issues and tracking data flow can be challenging.
Solution: Adopt clear naming conventions for context values. Use browser dev tools, React DevTools, and console logging to trace context data flow and identify potential issues.

why same port no are not used for frontend and backend?
Separation of Concerns: Frontend and backend are two distinct layers of an application with different responsibilities. Keeping them on separate ports helps maintain a clear separation of concerns and promotes modularity.
Security: Running the frontend and backend on different ports can enhance security by preventing direct access to the backend API from external sources. This helps protect sensitive server-side operations and data.
Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS): Browsers enforce the Same-Origin Policy, which restricts web pages from making requests to a different domain. By using different ports, you may run into CORS issues that require additional configuration to allow communication between the frontend and backend.
Scalability: Running the frontend and backend on separate ports allows for easier scalability. You can deploy multiple instances of the backend behind a load balancer without affecting the frontend's configuration.
Server-Side Considerations: Backend servers often have their own specific requirements and configuration needs that might not align with those of the frontend.
Clearer Configuration and Debugging: Using different ports makes it easier to configure and troubleshoot issues related to each layer independently.

why cors are used?
Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) is a security feature implemented by web browsers to control and regulate how web pages in one domain can request resources (like data, fonts, images, scripts, etc.) from another domain. CORS is used to prevent potential security risks that arise when web pages from one domain make unauthorized requests to resources hosted on a different domain.
