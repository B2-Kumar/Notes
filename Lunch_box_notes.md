How did you implement user authentication in your app?

Answer: I implemented user authentication using JSON Web Tokens (JWT) and bcrypt for password hashing. When a user registers or logs in, the server generates a JWT token that contains user information. This token is then sent to the client and included in subsequent requests for authentication. Bcrypt was used to securely hash and store user passwords in the database, ensuring sensitive data remains protected.

why className is used in place of class?
-class attribute in HTML is a reserved keyword in JavaScript. Since JSX is a JavaScript extension and not standard HTML, using class would result in a syntax error in your code. To avoid this conflict, React introduced the className attribute as an alternative to set CSS classes on JSX elements:

container in bootstrap.
